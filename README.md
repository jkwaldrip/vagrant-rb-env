# OLE QA Vagrant
---
## Create an Environment for Testing and Development with Kuality OLE

This repository installs a Vagrant box for 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr)
with a single-user RVM installation and Ruby 2.1.2.  This environment can 
be used for running or developing automated tests with [Kuality OLE](http://github.com/kuali/kuality-ole).

## Installation

With Vagrant installed and VirtualBox as a virtual machine provider, 
clone this repository to your preferred Vagrant directory, then
in a shell session, navigate to this directory and run:

    $ vagrant up

This will download the official Ubuntu 32-bit 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) VirtualBox machine,
then bring it online and install both RVM and Ruby.  Please note that downloading the
VirtualBox machine and installing Ruby will run for some time without output, so please
allow at least 15-30 minutes for these steps to complete.
